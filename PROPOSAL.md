# 2. Objectives and Key Features

## 2.1 Objective
- <Clear 1–2 sentence objective>

## 2.2 Core Requirements
- [ ] React Native + Expo (TypeScript)
- [ ] Multi-screen app (≥ 4 screens)
- [ ] Navigation (Expo Router **or** React Navigation) with typed routes/params
- [ ] State management (Context API / useReducer **or** Redux Toolkit where appropriate)
- [ ] Persistence (Async Storage)
- [ ] Notifications (Expo Notifications; at least one local notification)
- [ ] Backend integration (REST API or BaaS; live data fetch with loading/error states)
- [ ] Deployment plan (Expo EAS Build; testable build)

### 2.2.1 Navigation Structure
- Chosen library: <Expo Router | React Navigation>
- Screens (at least four):
  - <Screen 1 — purpose>
  - <Screen 2 — purpose>
  - <Screen 3 — purpose>
  - <Screen 4 — purpose>
- Data passing:
  - <Route params / search params usage>

### 2.2.2 State Management & Persistence
- Global vs module-level state:
- Chosen approach: <Context/useReducer | Redux Toolkit | hybrid>
- Persistence strategy (Async Storage keys/data):
- Error/loading handling patterns:

### 2.2.3 Device API (choose at least one)
- <Pedometer | Location | Camera | Sensors | Other>
- Permissions & user flows:

### 2.2.4 Notifications
- Notification type(s): <local / push (optional)>
- Scheduling & handling taps:
- Opt-in/opt-out behavior:

### 2.2.5 Backend Integration
- Backend choice: <Public REST API | Custom API | Firebase | Supabase | Appwrite | Other>
- Data to fetch/display:
- Request/response flow & error handling:
- API-driven navigation (if any):

### 2.2.6 Deployment
- Target(s): <Android APK / iOS (TestFlight) / Expo Go link>
- EAS Build configuration overview:

### 2.2.7 Advanced Features
- [ ] User Authentication (e.g., Firebase/Supabase/AuthSession)
- [ ] Real-Time Updates (WebSocket / BaaS Realtime)
- [ ] Mobile Sensors or Device APIs (Camera/Location/Sensors)
- [ ] Offline Support (Async Storage / SQLite / WatermelonDB)
- [ ] Custom Animations (Reanimated / Animated)
- [ ] Gamification (badges/streaks/progress)
- [ ] Integration with External Services (weather/news/calendar/etc.)
- [ ] Accessibility Enhancements (screen reader, high-contrast)
- [ ] Push Notifications (Expo Push / FCM / OneSignal)
- [ ] Social Sharing (Expo Sharing)
